Here, we replace older gutters attached with spikes with aluminum seamless gutters using hangers. We move from 2x3 in downspouts to 3x4 in downspouts which doubles the water flow.

We replaced box miters with strip miters. Both are great working solutions for your water removal solution. We also added splash guards to inside corners because water coming down valley has increased volume and on the valley flashing has increased speed. The splash guards keep the water from overshooting the gutter.

In the end, this house had a great set of gutters, that ran water to the ground without damaging the yard or the foundation, which is really what we're targeting.
